# Proxying IP over HTTP

Quick and dirty fork of the awesome [connect-ip-go](https://github.com/quic-go/connect-ip-go) to add support for the non [RFC 9484](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9484) compliant Cloudflare implementation.

Unless you have very specific needs like me, you should probably use the original. There is no guarantee for API stability or feature parity with the original library.
